  <h5>FAQs</h5>
  <b>What are spear-phishing messages?</b>
  <p>
	Spear-phishing messages are focused messages designed to obtain specific information from a target.  In particular, spear-phishing emails usually purport to be sent by someone the target trusts, and they ask the target to do something specific (usually to provide some form of information).  Generally, they take advantage of the trust in an established relationship to convince the target to do something that they would otherwise not do.  Often, they will use a combination of time pressure and/or situational pressure to make the target less likely to ask questions about the task.  For example, an email claiming to come from a CEO urgently asking for a list of clients before an important meeting is likely to receive an immediate response.  Spear-phishing messages also often include information that the target would expect only real acquaintances to know.  The most extreme spear-phishing attacks may include details of the target's personal life that were posted on Facebook.  More commonplace examples include displaying knowledge of the target's precise job function or family relationships.
  </p>

  <b>What makes spear-phishing different from regular phishing?</b>

  <p>
	An ordinary phishing message is usually a message that is sent to a large number of people, claiming to come from a popular website and designed to encourage the targets to click a link.  Attackers often use these messages to collect login information for email, social media, or financial service websites.  These messages rely on a relatively small fraction of the targets clicking a link and providing a username and password, and the information sought generally is not specific to an individual or company.  Also, the only personal information included in such emails are the targets' emails, and occasionally names.
